# ColourRunner
Mini game built using the Mojo v3 FPGA and an Arithmetic Logic Unit
This project is built upon the 16 bit ALU created [here](https://github.com/weijin96/16bitALU)

## Rules of the Game

• Colour Runner is a 2-player game where one should try to beat their opponent in terms of their finger speed and hand-eye coordination.

• Each player need to press a button that corresponds to the colour at the end of their column.

• The fastest player that can finish a sequence of colour will win the game.

• Each player will have 2 lives, meaning that when they miss the seconds time, they will lose the game immediately.

• In an event where any player mis-press the button, they will experience a delay and they will lose a life.

• The result of each game is shown through their playing column. Winner's player column will turn blue while Loser's player column will turn off.

There's an added HARDCORE mode where each player only has 1 life. Meaning that once they miss, they will lose the game immediately.
